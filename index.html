        User experience design (UX design, UXD, UED, or XD) is the process of
        defining the experience a user would go through when interacting with a
        digital product or website. Design decisions in UX design are often
        driven by research, data analysis, and test results rather than
        aesthetic preferences and opinions. Unlike user interface design, which
        focuses solely on the design of a computer interface, UX design
        encompasses all aspects of a user's perceived experience with a product
        or website, such as its usability, usefulness, desirability, brand
        perception, and overall performance. UX design is also an element of the
        customer experience (CX), which encompasses all aspects and stages of a
        customer's experience and interaction with a company.

          Web designers plan, create and code internet sites and web pages, many
          of which combine text with sounds, pictures, graphics and video clips.
          A web designer is responsible for creating the design and layout of a
          website or web pages. It and can mean working on a brand new website
          or updating an already existing site.
